# Team-Profile-Generator
Week 10: Object-Oriented Programming Challenge

## Team Profile Generator
A Node.js command-line application is built which will allow to take in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
This application uses Inquirer package v8.2.4, JEST, html, JavaScript, CSS powered by jQuery and Bootstrap.


Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.
